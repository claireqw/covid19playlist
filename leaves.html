          <h1> “Leaves from the Vine” </h1>
          “Leaves from the Vine” comes from the Nickelodeon TV Show <span class="italic">Avatar: The Last Airbender</span>, which is 15 years old in 2020 but is being watched by many fans, old and new, during the shelter-in-place, especially due to the fact that it was added to Netflix. This is also a show I rewatched recently, and it and this song are personal favorites for me. Iroh, the character singing the song, had been a great general in the Fire Nation’s imperialistic war for world domination until he lost his son in the battle, after which he lost the will to fight. Although he was the crown prince of the nation, he no longer cared for power and didn’t challenge his brother who took the throne. Instead, he traveled the world and reexamined what he really cared about in life: love, compassion, empathy. For someone who was raised during a war in a royal family that lusted for power, Iroh was able to turn his back on these ways and understand what really matters. His story is a heartbreaking one, but after a tragedy, Iroh used that as an opportunity to better his life. This reminds us of what is truly important, to keep those values with us during difficult times, and how we can come out of this pandemic with a stronger, kinder, society.
