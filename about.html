        <h1>COVID-19</h1>
        The novel coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 as pneumonia cases.
        In January 2020, Chinese scientists announced the discovery of the new type of coronavirus,
        and later that month the World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency.
        It is now classified as a pandemic, as the virus has spread across multiple countries.
        In many countries, measures are taken to keep people at home to avoid transmission of the virus.
        This has led to shelter-in-place orders in many areas, including Santa Clara County.
        With people stuck at home in these uncertain times, music is one form of alleviation for the uncertain and turbulent emotions.
        This project explores a playlist of music I compiled and how it relates to the current situation.
